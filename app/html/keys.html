                        be used in the case that you want to send them an encrypted email, as well as to verify their PGP signature.

                    <small>- PGP encryption/ signing features can only be used when the sender or recepient of your emails is a 
                        person who is defined in your contacts list.

                        will be used to encrypt your private key. If you forget your passphrase, your Keypair will be
                        rendered useless.

                    email client, you should remember your private key passphrase, since the private key is
