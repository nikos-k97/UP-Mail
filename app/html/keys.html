                        be used in the case that you want to send them an encrypted email.
                    </small>
                    <small>- You can only send encypted emails to the people who are defined in your contacts list.
                    </small>
                    <small>- When you add a person to your contacts, it means that you are confident of that person's
                        identity, and that the <strong>Public Key</strong> really belongs to them.

                        will be used to encrypt your private key. If you forget your passphrase, your Keypair will be
                        rendered useless.
